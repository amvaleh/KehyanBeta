This is a Rails application which has been built using
[Shoppe](http://github.com/tryshoppe/core). It features a lovely design to fully
demonstrate the functionality provided by the Shoppe platform and how well it works
with a Rails application.

## Getting Started


A few notes about this demo store:

* this is just an interface, added to github for performance in betterizing the web site user interface 

* Once up and running, you can access the Shoppe interface at `/shoppe` and use
  **admin@example.com** and **password** to login.
